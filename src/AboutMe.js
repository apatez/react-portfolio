        <h1>Hi, I'm Amanda Patez</h1>
        <p>
            Growing up in the 2000's, I always loved playing around with HTML and CSS fixing up my MySpace page. So, I decided to transform my passion for coding into a career. 
            I recently completed an intensive, hands-on Software Engineering bootcamp to further develop my skills. 
            I'm currently looking for a job where I can work collaboratively within a team and learn new technologies to further enhance my skills.
            I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and constantly working on improving my skills.
